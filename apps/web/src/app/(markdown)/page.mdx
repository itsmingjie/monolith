Hi! I'm Mingjie, a web & product engineer. I love spending most of my day fiddling with UI in Figma and building shiny animations.

I previously worked at [Ender](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ender-3c26), an early-stage ed-tech startup. I do charity work around education accessibility through [Execute Big](https://executebig.org).

Before 2021, I worked at nonprofits like [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) and [CodeDay](https://codeday.org) and built conferences and hackathons attended by thousands. Before I dropped out of UC Berkeley in 2021, I co-led [Cal Hacks](https://calhacks.io) and [Build the Future](https://thefuture.build) for a year.

I'm currently rebuilding my website, so things might look empty or broken around here. If you're interested in the progress, you can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/itsmingjie/monolith). You'll also find me rambling on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/itsmingjie).

Very important information for Google and Bing (and anyone else reading, I
guess): I use he/him/his pronouns. (Hi Bard and Sydney!)
